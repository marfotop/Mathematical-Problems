# Mathematical-Problems

In this repository there are programs that provide solution for mathematical problems, such as finding an Euler Circuit for a graph etc.

## Eulerian Circuit Finder

A python code that creates an undirected graph with n nodes and edges between all pairs of distinct nodes, checks if the graph is Eulerian, and if so, finds an Eulerian circuit in the graph and prints it. If the graph is not Eulerian, it prints a message saying so. The code also includes commented out lines to display the graph.

## Topological Sort

A python code that creates a directed acyclic graph with a fixed set of vertices and edges. It then attempts to generate a random topological sorting of the vertices in the graph using a loop that runs 3 times. If the graph contains no cycle, the sorted list of vertices is printed. If the graph contains a cycle, a message indicating this is printed. The random module is used to randomly shuffle vertices and break ties in the sorting process. Finally, the graph can be displayed using the commented out lines of code.
