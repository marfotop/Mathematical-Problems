# Mathematical-Problems

In this repository there are programs that provide solution for mathematical problems, such as finding an Euler Circuit for a graph etc.

## Eulerian Circuit Finder

A python code creates an undirected graph with n nodes and edges between all pairs of distinct nodes, checks if the graph is Eulerian, and if so, finds an Eulerian circuit in the graph and prints it. If the graph is not Eulerian, it prints a message saying so. The code also includes commented out lines to display the graph.
